But for this one season, they're sharing the stage together.\n","Performing Side-By-Side In The Nutcracker\n","Regina and Melina are not only dancing in the same Nutcracker this month, they're onstage at the same time: Regina is doing Snow Queen, while Melina is in the snow corps, and they're both in the Arabian divertissement. \"It's very surreal to be dancing it together,\" says Regina. \"I don't know that I ever thought Melina would take ballet this far.\"\n","Left: Regina and Melina with another company member post-snow scene in 2003.

While on tour with ABT at the Kennedy Center, the duo sat down in front of the camera to answer some questions from their fans via Facebook Live.\n","Starbucks in hand, they discuss their mutual love of food (particularly pasta and Japanese curry), the story behind the Cindy nickname and what it's like picking up contemporary choreography versus classical. Boylston also delves into her experience guesting with the Paris Opéra Ballet, her dream of choreographing an avant-garde ballet on Whiteside to a Carly Rae Jepsen song and best and worst Kennedy Center memories (like the time she fell onstage while doing fouettés at the end of La Bayadère's first act).\n","Whiteside, on the other hand, imitates a unicorn, talks about preparing for roles and creates a new middle name for Boylston. The twosome also offer heartfelt advice for aspiring professional dancers.\n","Check out the highlights in this video below; for the full 24-minute version, click here.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["delete_line_sep = re.compile('[\\n]+')"],"metadata":{"id":"e0dLKFOsMw74","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["with open('en_data.txt', 'w') as file:\n","\n","    for rec in tqdm(cc_news):\n","\n","        text = delete_line_sep.sub('', rec['text']).lower()\n","        text = sent_tokenize(text)\n","\n","        for sent in text:\n","            file.write(sent + '\\n')\n","\n","        "],"metadata":{"id":"NoDRlQ8VOWgE","trusted":true,"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1655541286572,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":464885,"user":{"displayName":"Шлёнский Даниил Александрович","userId":"03999950142072217074"}},"outputId":"d9e48d59-3206-49bb-ea3b-7acc0436cfc3"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["100%|██████████| 708241/708241 [07:44<00:00, 1523.84it/s]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Russian data preprocessing"],"metadata":{"id":"Yba683kklCph"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!wget https://github.com/buriy/russian-nlp-datasets/releases/download/r4/news-articles-2014.tar.bz2\n","!wget https://github.com/buriy/russian-nlp-datasets/releases/download/r4/news-articles-2015-part1.tar.bz2\n","!wget https://github.com/buriy/russian-nlp-datasets/releases/download/r4/news-articles-2015-part2.tar.bz2"],"metadata":{"id":"SXo4-ZUn1O7g","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install corus"],"metadata":{"id":"ACoP-5Ua1YQP","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from corus import load_buriy_news\n"],"metadata":{"id":"PKGPgXsF1Dzo","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["path1 = 'news-articles-2014.tar.bz2'\n","path2 = 'news-articles-2015-part1.tar.bz2'\n","path3 = 'news-articles-2015-part2.tar.bz2'\n","\n","records1 = load_buriy_news(path1)\n","records2 = load_buriy_news(path2)\n","records3 = load_buriy_news(path3)"],"metadata":{"id":"Kabb0kuz1OdV","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(next(records1).text)\n","print('###')\n","print(next(records2).text)\n","print('###')\n","print(next(records3).text)"],"metadata":{"id":"QBpC8hlD_Adm","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["delete_line_sep = re.compile('[\\n]+')\n","change_dash_symb = re.compile('\\x97')"],"metadata":{"trusted":true,"id":"ZROE4QRxaoWD"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["with open('ru_data.txt', 'w') as file:\n","\n","    for i, records in enumerate([records1, records2, records3]):\n","\n","        for rec in tqdm(records):\n","            text = delete_line_sep.sub('', rec.text)\n","            text = change_dash_symb.sub('-', text).lower()\n","            text = sent_tokenize(text)\n","            \n","            for sent in text:\n","                file.wirte(sent + '\\n')"],"metadata":{"trusted":true,"id":"7XkhCRGbaoWE"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
